# grid-monitor
The Grid Monitor Program was a project I completed in my Computer Science II course, where I developed an object-oriented system to manage and analyze a two-dimensional grid of data. The program's primary function was to process numerical values in a grid and calculate derivative grids based on specific formulas, such as finding the sum, average, or other mathematical relationships between neighboring cells.

To ensure the program was well-structured, I created UML diagrams during the planning phase, which helped outline the relationships between classes, their responsibilities, and methods. This approach made the implementation process more organized and modular.

Throughout the project, I focused on algorithmic thinking to handle edge cases and ensure the program performed calculations efficiently for various grid sizes. Debugging played a significant role as I resolved logic errors and ensured the program adhered to the problem specifications.

Key takeaways from this project included improving my ability to design systems using UML diagrams, applying modular programming techniques, and developing robust solutions through testing and debugging. The project helped solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming and algorithm design while enhancing my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.
